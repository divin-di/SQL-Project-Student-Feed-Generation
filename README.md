# SQL-Project(Student_feed_geneartion)
The goal of this project is to generate random student feed data into three separate feeds (Feed-1, Feed-2, Feed-3), automate the data generation, identify and cleanse duplicate entries, update data with unique rows, compare feeds, and validate the results. The process is built entirely in SQL Server with automation and testing using SQL.

Requirements:

Req1	Generate a random data input files
a) Feed-1  which has 10 columns with 10 rows,
b) Feed-2 which has 15 columns with 15 rows ,
c) Feed-3 which has 20 columns  with 20 rows
Req2	Automate the Req 1 input file generation using SQL  scripts and the parameter will be "Feed name" & Number of Rows to populate Data
Req3	Write SQL script to identify the duplicate (rows) in each of the table Feed-1, 2, 3
Req4	Write the duplicate records in output file - "duplicates"
Req5	Create a script to replace all the duplicates with Unique rows and update back to respective Feed table
Req6	Execute the duplicate script and check the output is zero
Req7	Create SQL script to compare data from Feed-2,3 to Feed-1 and write in output file on the compared results
Req8	Create Test plan with all kinds of manual test cases in order to test this End to End functionality
Req9	Automate the test cases (if possible) using any method but should be automated…
Req 10	Document everything in word with all screen grabs as proper Project Document
